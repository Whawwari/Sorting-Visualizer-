# Sorting-Visualizer-
Sorting-Visualizer offers a visual representation to demonstrate how sorting algorithms work in real time.

Upon accessing the application, users are prompted to choose the number of elements they wish to sort and the specific sorting algorithm they want to observe. The application then generates a randomized array of the specified size and visually displays the step-by-step process of the chosen sorting algorithm using a series of bar graphs. Each step of the algorithm is represented as a static image, showcasing the current state of the array as the algorithm progresses.

Moving forward, I'd like to integrate this project into an interactive website, most likely using Flask.
